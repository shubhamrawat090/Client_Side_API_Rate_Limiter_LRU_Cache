BUGS
- it shows next to evict always. It should ideally only show when minimum MAX_SIZE(4) entries are in the LRU Storage View.
- There is some isDone() function there which sets status pending or completed. I don't want that use API's isCompleted only.


IMPROVEMENTS
- Add Dark/Light Mode
- We can click an item on the LRU Storage view list and it opens a wider view. This calls the get function and make the item MRU.
